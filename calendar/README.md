# Calendar

This is a simple calendar program written in Python. It is a work in progress.

Features to be added:
- delete events
- modify events

This is not currently designed to persist events between runnings of the program. It may, in future, be modified to work with a database, but the current iteration will delete the calendar when the program is closed.
